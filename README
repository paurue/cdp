REQUIREMENTS:
This software has been built with GNU C compiler (gcc) in Linux and Mac OS X.
In addition, the code uses the random number generator from the Gnu Scientific 
Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and the fast fourier transform 
subrutines from the FFTW library (http://www.fftw.org/).

INSTALLATION:
Go to the src/ directory and build the code
	$ cd src/
	$ make
	$ cp cdp ../

USAGE:
	$ ./cdp param_name

here 'param_name' is the name of the parameters file (without extension) found in the 'parfile/' directory (i.e., 'parfile/param_name.par').
